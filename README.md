This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, 

  1. Fork this repo from `develop` branch and 
  2. Clone the forked repo into your local machine. 
  3. Make sure your machine's current **Node** version is set to `20.x.x`
  4. If you don't have `yarn` package manager then run `npm install -g yarn`
  5. Open the cloned repo into your VS-Code editor and run `yarn` command into **Terminal**/**Git Bash**
  6. After successful installation, you are ready to run the development server

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Contribution Guideline

  1. Create your feature branch (e.g. `d2d-001`) from `develop` branch, `git checkout -b d2d-001`
  2. Add your changes, commit and push it
  3. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your forked repo to this repo's `develop` branch
  4. Add [Tajnur](https://github.com/tajnur007) and/or [Fardin](https://github.com/fardin17) as reviewer

Always checkout to `develop` branch before create a new branch. And after that get pull from `develop` barnch i.e. `git pull origin develop`.
